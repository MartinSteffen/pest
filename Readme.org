** Abstract


The repository collects the /sources/ of the ``Mist'' project
(/Model-checking environment for state-transition systems/) , in the
software programming lab course ``Programming in the Many'', summer
semester 2000, at the University Kiel.

For the webpages of the course project, see [[http://heim.ifi.uio.no/msteffen/teaching/softtech/ss00/pitm-mist/mist/][here]]


** Structure
This is the root of the Snot-project from the summer term 2001.  The
package contains the following files and subdirectories:

  

    - [[,/Readme.org]]:        this file
    - [[./Prototyp]]:          requirement spec for that
    - [[./Pflichtenheft/]]     requirement specification
    - [[./Baselines]]:         short description about major
                           development steps (CVS tags)
    - [[./examples]]:          for testing
    - [[./web]]:               some extra web-pages
    - [[./tex/]]               common LaTeX-macros 


** Historical notes

The repository has been resurrected by migrating from ~cvs~ via svn (using
~cvs2svn~) and from there to ~git~. Caveats concerning missing branches
apply. Also the /Snapshots/ or baselines (original svn revision tags) seem
not to be preserved as git labels in the final repository (see the
[[./Baselines]]-file).  Also, original /authors/ have not been preserved, as
the original development was done all via a common login ~swprakt~; in
general, the contributors were the different students in the course plus
the course teachers.
