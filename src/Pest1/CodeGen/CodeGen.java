/**
 *
 * This class provides a simple interface to other parts
 * of pest.
 * path is a path name to a directory, where CodeGen will
 * store its files.
 * We expect path to be a valid path name, that is, it is
 * a directory, indeed, and the directory is writable.
 *
 * Statechart is a syntactically correct and valid statechart.
 *
 * If an error occures, we will throw a CodeGenException.
 *
 * Prerequisites:  We expect the Statechart to be a complete,
 *     executable and correct state chart.  We will not announce
 *     an error, but instead create incorrect code (as far as it
 *     is possible to talk about incorrect code).  The pathname
 *     is assumed to be a fully qualified path to an existing
 *     directory without trailing "/".
